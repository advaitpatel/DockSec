# Changelog

All notable changes to DockSec will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [2026.8.19] - 2026-08-19

### Added

- **Repo-level configuration file (`.docksec.yml`)**: a committed policy file for severity, `fail_on`, report formats, output directory, provider/model, waiver and baseline paths, and disabled rules, so a team's scan policy lives in the repository instead of in per-developer flags and environment variables. Discovery starts in the working directory and walks up to the repository root (stopping at the directory containing `.git`), so a service in a monorepo subdirectory inherits the policy committed at the top level. Precedence is CLI flag > environment variable > `.docksec.yml` > built-in default, so committed policy never overrides an explicit flag or an exported variable. The config file in force is shown in the scan banner.
- **`--config FILE` and `--no-config`**: use a specific config file, or skip discovery entirely for reproducible CI runs.
- **Per-rule disabling (`rules.disabled`)**: switches individual rules off before scoring, reports, `--json`, and the `--fail-on` gate, so a disabled rule cannot influence the security score. Matching is case-insensitive on the rule ID. The waiver file (`.docksec-ignore.yml`) remains the right tool for individual triaged findings, since its entries carry a reason and an expiry date.
- **`--print-config-schema`**: emits a JSON Schema for the config file, committed at `docs/docksec-config-schema.json`. The `# yaml-language-server:` comment in the example config enables autocomplete and inline validation in VS Code and JetBrains editors.
- **Annotated example config** at `examples/.docksec.yml`.

### Changed

- `--offline`, `--no-cache`, `--no-redact`, and `--skip-ai-scoring` now default to `None` rather than `False` internally, so an absent flag is distinguishable from an explicit `false` and no longer overrides a value set in the config file. Behavior is unchanged when no config file is present.

### Fixed

- **Invalid config files fail loudly**: a config file that exists but cannot be used as written (unknown key, invalid severity or provider value, malformed YAML) exits `2` with the offending key and file path named, rather than warning and continuing. This is deliberately stricter than the ignore file, where a malformed entry is skipped with a warning: a broken policy file must not silently scan under rules the team did not commit.
- **Lint rule set pinned**: `[tool.ruff.lint] select` in `pyproject.toml` now fixes the enabled rules instead of inheriting ruff's defaults, which change between releases. Ruff 0.16 enabled several new rule groups by default and failed CI on every pull request without any code change.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **CycloneDX SBOM export (`--sbom`)**: writes a spec-compliant CycloneDX software bill of materials (`<image>.cdx.json`) of the scanned image, covering the full package inventory plus known vulnerabilities. The BOM is produced by Trivy's native exporter and DockSec is stamped into the tool metadata. Opt-in and independent of `--format`; requires a single image (`-i`), so it is skipped for compose runs. The path is surfaced in the report summary and in `--json` output under `report_files`.
- **Offline mode (`--offline`)**: runs a scan with no network access, using the already-downloaded Trivy vulnerability database (`--offline-scan --skip-db-update`) and skipping the AI analysis and the Docker Scout advanced scan (both require network). Makes air-gapped scanning a single flag.
- **`install-skill` subcommand**: `docksec install-skill` writes DockSec usage instructions into the well-known context files for AI coding assistants (Claude Code `.claude/commands/docksec.md`, Cursor `.cursor/rules/docksec.mdc`, Codex `AGENTS.md`, Gemini `GEMINI.md`, GitHub Copilot `.github/copilot-instructions.md`). Re-running updates the DockSec section in place rather than duplicating it. Added via backward-compatible subcommand dispatch: all existing flag-based usage is unchanged.
- **Fixable-count and suggested-fix output**: the terminal result summary now reports how many findings have a fixed version available upstream (e.g. "28 of 40 have a fixed version available upstream") and prints a "Suggested fixes" block of concrete, severity-ranked, deduplicated upgrade hints (`upgrade PKG installed -> fixed`). Trivy's `FixedVersion` is now threaded into every finding, so it is also present in the JSON/CSV/SARIF outputs.

### Changed

- HTML report redesigned with a clean, professional, dark-mode-aware theme (replacing the previous purple-gradient style); all report data classes preserved.

### Fixed

- **HTML report dropped all AI findings**: the HTML report only rendered Trivy's package vulnerabilities, never the LLM findings (vulnerabilities, best practices, security risks, exposed credentials, remediation steps). For an AI-only run (Dockerfile analysis with no image) there are no Trivy vulnerabilities, so the HTML showed nothing but the security score even though the terminal reported dozens of findings. The complete AI findings now render in a dedicated "AI Dockerfile Analysis" section, so the report is the authoritative place to read the full list that the terminal only previews. (The PDF and JSON reports already carried these findings.)
- **`get_llm()` crashed with `NameError` on any LLM init failure**: the exception handler referenced a module-level `console` defined later in the file, so a bad API key / no credits / network error raised `NameError: name 'console' is not defined` instead of showing the troubleshooting steps. Now routed through the shared output layer.

## [2026.7.3] - 2026-07-02

### Fixed

- **AI analysis without an image wrote no report, but claimed it did**: running an AI analysis with a Dockerfile but no image (e.g. `docksec Dockerfile --provider anthropic`, or `--ai-only`) set the tool into a mode where the AI pass ran but the scan pass — the only place reports were generated — did not. No report file was written, yet the tool still printed "For detailed AI analysis, check the generated reports at: ...", pointing at a directory that contained only stale files from previous runs. Since the on-screen findings are truncated to the top few per section, the full AI findings were effectively unreachable. AI-only runs now write the complete findings to a report (JSON/CSV/PDF/HTML, plus SARIF with `--sarif`), honoring `--format` and `--output-dir`, and the "reports written" message is only shown when a report was actually generated.

## [2026.7.2] - 2026-07-02

### Fixed

- **Scan cache ignored `--severity`**: `ScanResultsCache` keyed cached results by image name only, so scanning an image at a narrow severity (e.g. `CRITICAL`) and then re-scanning the same image at a wider severity (e.g. `CRITICAL,HIGH,MEDIUM`) silently served the stale, narrower cached result instead of re-scanning, dropping HIGH/MEDIUM findings from the report. The cache key now includes the normalized severity list.
- **AI analysis failures exited 0**: an exception during the AI analysis pass (bad provider/API key, model error) printed `error AI analysis failed: ...` but still exited `0`, contradicting the documented exit-code contract. AI failures now exit `3` (tool/runtime error), matching scan failures.
- **HTML report crashed on a null vulnerability title**: Trivy can return `"Title": null` for some findings; the HTML report writer called `len()` on that field unconditionally and crashed generation for the whole report, silently dropping HTML off the report list whenever a scan hit one of these findings. Vulnerability ID, package name, installed version, and title are now null-safe in the HTML report.
- **`--compose --scan-only` printed an unrelated Dockerfile message**: "No image provided for scan-only mode. Running Dockerfile analysis only." fired for any `--scan-only` run without `--image`, including pure `--compose` runs where no Dockerfile is involved. Now scoped to non-compose runs.
- **Compose vulnerability findings could be invisible to the security score**: when every per-service image scan in a compose file failed (e.g. images not pulled locally), the score calculator treated the vulnerabilities axis as unmeasured and excluded it from the weighted average, even though compose static-misconfiguration findings (privileged mode, host network, etc.) were present. A compose file with multiple CRITICAL findings could score "GOOD". The vulnerabilities axis is now always included whenever findings exist, regardless of whether the image-scan sub-check ran.
- **Security score understated hardcoded credential exposure**: a Dockerfile with hardcoded secrets, no `USER` directive, and other severe misconfigurations could still land in the mid-40s ("POOR" but not alarming) because the blended dockerfile/vulnerabilities/configuration average diluted the credential-exposure penalty. The overall score is now capped at 20/100 whenever a hardcoded credential-looking `ENV` variable (password/secret/API key/token) is detected in the Dockerfile.

### Added
- Docker Compose security scanning support (`--compose` flag).
- Detection for compose-level misconfigurations (e.g., privileged mode, host network, missing resource limits).
- Automatic scanning of all services defined in a docker-compose file.
- Integration of compose findings into the existing LLM remediation and scoring pipeline.
- `DOCKSEC_LOG_LEVEL` environment variable to override log verbosity (e.g. `DOCKSEC_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG`) for troubleshooting.
- **Redesigned terminal output**: a consolidated result summary with a box-drawing severity table, the security score with a color-coded rating, a "Quick take" action block highlighting the most important findings, the list of generated reports, and a suggested next command.
- `--quiet` flag to reduce output to warnings, errors, and the result summary.
- `--no-color` flag (also honors the `NO_COLOR` environment variable) to disable colored output.
- `--severity` flag to choose which severity levels the image vulnerability scan reports (default `CRITICAL,HIGH`; also settable via `DOCKSEC_DEFAULT_SEVERITY`). Invalid values are rejected with a clear error.
- `--fail-on <severity>` flag: exit with code 1 when any finding is at or above the chosen severity (`CRITICAL`, `HIGH`, `MEDIUM`, or `LOW`). The scan severity is auto-widened when needed so the gate can observe those findings.
- CI-friendly exit codes: `0` clean, `1` findings at or above `--fail-on`, `2` usage/argument error, `3` tool or runtime error (scan failed, image not found, missing tools).
- `--format` flag to choose which report formats are written (`json`, `csv`, `pdf`, `html`; default: all). Invalid values are rejected with a clear error.
- `--output-dir` flag to write reports to a specific directory for the run (default: `~/.docksec/results` or `DOCKSEC_RESULTS_DIR`).
- `--json` flag: print scan results as a single JSON object to stdout for scripts and CI pipelines. All human-readable output (banner, sections, info/warn/error, the result summary) moves to stderr in `--json` mode, so stdout carries only the JSON payload. `--json` alone does not write report files; combine with `--format` to also write files.
- `--sarif` flag: write a SARIF 2.1.0 report for GitHub Code Scanning and other SARIF-compatible tools. Independent of `--format`; findings map to one SARIF rule per unique vulnerability ID and one result per finding, with severity mapped to SARIF levels (`CRITICAL`/`HIGH` -> `error`, `MEDIUM` -> `warning`, `LOW`/`UNKNOWN` -> `note`).
- GitHub Action inputs for the new CLI flags: `output_dir`, `severity`, `fail_on`, `format`, `sarif`.
- `--baseline <file>` and `--update-baseline` flags for ratchet-mode adoption: `--update-baseline` snapshots the current scan's findings to the baseline file; subsequent runs with `--baseline` and `--fail-on` only gate on findings not already present in the baseline, so `--fail-on` can be adopted on existing projects without pre-existing findings blocking every build. Findings are matched by vulnerability ID, target, and package name.

### Changed
- **Cleaner terminal output**: internal logs now write to `stderr` instead of `stdout` and stay quiet in CLI mode, so raw location-tagged log lines no longer interleave with the tool's user-facing messages. Set `DOCKSEC_LOG_LEVEL` to restore verbose logging.
- `docker_scanner.py`'s Hadolint/Trivy/Docker Scout error and troubleshooting messages now route through `docksec.output` instead of raw `print()`, so they're consistently styled and honor `--quiet`/`--no-color`/`--json` like the rest of the tool's output.
- The security score is now rendered once, in the result summary, instead of mid-scan.
- Report generation runs silently and the CLI renders a single report summary from the result (removes the misleading progress bars).
- **Honest exit codes**: a failed scan (for example, an image that is not found) now exits non-zero instead of ending with "Analysis complete!".

### Fixed (GitHub Action)
- The Action's `output` input was passed to the CLI as `-o`/`--output`, a flag removed earlier in this release; setting it caused every run to fail with an argument-parsing error. It is now remapped to `--output-dir` (kept as a deprecated alias; the new `output_dir` input is preferred).

### Fixed
- **PDF report encoding**: PDF generation no longer fails on non-latin-1 characters (bullets, smart quotes, em dashes, emoji) in vulnerability titles, scanner output, or AI findings; such characters are sanitized consistently across the whole document.
- Suppressed the noisy `PyFPDF & fpdf2` import warning that printed on every run.
- Fixed report progress output that printed each step twice and out of order (caused by mixing `print()` with a live progress display).

### Removed
- Removed the unused `-o/--output` CLI flag, which was declared but never wired up.
- Removed dead duplicate report-writer methods from `DockerSecurityScanner`; report generation is handled solely by `ReportGenerator`.
- Removed the leftover `compose_scanner_cli.py` placeholder module.

## [2026.5.22.2] - 2026-05-22

- **Improved Storage Logic**: Added automatic directory creation and a smart fallback to local storage if the home directory is not writable.
- **CLI Feedback**: The tool now explicitly prints the report storage location at the start of every scan for better visibility.

### Fixed
- **PDF Layout**: Resolved the "Not enough horizontal space" error that occurred during PDF generation for complex scan results.
- **Deprecation Warnings**: Eliminated all font and layout-related deprecation warnings from the `fpdf2` library.
- **Test Suite**: Updated and expanded the unit test suite to cover new reporting logic and dynamic tool requirements, achieving 100% pass rate.
